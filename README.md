## The Scouter App

This project was built as an assesment for an internship with an Agtech Firm in Brazil. Was the recruiter impressed? Yes.
Did I get the internship? No.

# The Scouterr App

The app was built as a data collection solution for farmers on the field who go scouting. Scouting is when a farmer goes round the farm land to inspect the crops or animals and notes some observation to act upon them later.

## What was implemented and used
I had implemented an email authentication using firebase. I also used firebase to host the app here: https://scouter-app-df231.firebaseapp.com .
The app UI was designed using material-ui
